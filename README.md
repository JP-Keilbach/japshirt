This is a starter-theme for WordPress based on Foundation 6, the most advanced responsive (mobile-first) framework in the world. The purpose of FoundationPress, is to act as a small and handy toolbox that contains the essentials needed to build any design. FoundationPress is meant to be a starting point, not the final product.

Please fork, copy, modify, delete, share or do whatever you like with this.

## Requirements

This project requires [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) v4.x.x  to be installed on your machine. Please be aware that you may encounter problems with the installation if you are using v5.1.0 with all the latest features.

FoundationPress uses [Sass](http://Sass-lang.com/) (CSS with superpowers). In short, Sass is a CSS pre-processor that allows you to write styles more effectively and tidy.

The Sass is compiled using libsass, which requires the GCC to be installed on your machine. Windows users can install it through [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/), and Mac users can install it through the [Xcode Command-line Tools](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).

If you have not worked with a Sass-based workflow before, I would recommend reading [FoundationPress for beginners](https://foundationpress.olefredrik.com/posts/tutorials/foundationpress-for-beginners), a short blog post that explains what you need to know.
